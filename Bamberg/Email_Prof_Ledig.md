Subject: Application — Doctoral Student (TV-L E13) at xAILab (Earliest start date: [Your date])

Dear Prof. Ledig,

I am writing to apply for the Doctoral Student position (TV-L E13) at the Chair of Explainable Machine Learning. I am a PhD candidate in AI at Amirkabir University of Technology (AGML Center) with an MSc in AI from USI (Lugano). My research centers on robust and interpretable ML with a focus on time-series and imaging data.

My background combines ML/DL research and engineering: PyTorch, self-/weakly-supervised learning, outlier detection, and uncertainty estimation; plus systems experience (Python, FastAPI, Docker). Recent work includes ASD-GraphNet (fMRI graph learning for autism diagnosis; Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2025) and an under-review paper (HIDE-KG) proposing a dual-learning validation framework for knowledge graph construction using LLMs. During my Master’s I co-founded UbiHealth (covered by USI News) and completed Innosuisse Entrepreneurship Training.

I attach a single PDF (motivation letter, concise CV, and research proposal). The proposal outlines a dual-learning validation and perturbation-based explainability framework for knowledge graphs derived from time-series data (uni-/multivariate), aiming to improve reliability, data efficiency, and interpretability—well aligned with the group’s topics.

I would be grateful for your consideration. I am available to start on [Your earliest start date] and would welcome the chance to discuss fit. Thank you for your time.
