Subject: PhD in Agentic AI and Human–AI Collaboration (Job ID 1557) — Application Support

Dear Prof. Blohm,

Thank you for accepting my LinkedIn connection and for sharing the openings in Agentic AI and Generative AI. I am a PhD candidate in AI at Amirkabir University of Technology (AGML Center), with an MSc in AI from USI (Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland). My research and industry work focus on building and evaluating AI assistants and ML systems, and I am very excited about the PhD/Research Associate role in your group (Job ID 1557).

My background combines ML/DL/NLP and Generative AI with strong Python engineering (PyTorch, scikit-learn), web services (FastAPI), and containerization. I have hands-on experience prototyping LLM-powered agents and deploying production backends (e.g., at Tali AI). I also co-founded UbiHealth during my Master’s at USI (covered by USI News), and completed Innosuisse Entrepreneurship Training in Ticino.

In parallel, I have a paper under review on an agentic AI approach to knowledge graph construction (HIDE-KG). It uses a dual-learning validation mechanism (text-based reconstruction and re-parsing) to reduce hallucinations and improve reliability—an approach I believe is relevant for organizational AI where multi-source data must be structured into actionable knowledge.

Given my current situation (supervisor relocation) and close alignment with your research, I would be grateful for your support of my application and any guidance on fit and next steps. If convenient, may I request a brief 20-minute call to discuss how my profile could contribute to your team?

I have attached my CV and a one-page cover letter. Thank you for your time.

Best regards,

## LinkedIn follow-up message (short)

Hello Prof. Blohm — thank you for connecting. I’ve applied for the PhD/Research Associate role in Agentic AI and Human–AI Collaboration (Job ID 1557). My work spans ML/DL/NLP, LLM agents (FastAPI, PyTorch, LangChain), and an under-review paper (HIDE-KG) on dual-learning validation for knowledge graph construction in organizational settings. I’d value your feedback on fit and would appreciate a short call if possible. Thank you!
