Subject: Application — Remote Internship/Research Collaboration on Multimodal VLMs + KGs (QCRI)

Dear Dr. Diba,

Thank you for sharing the opportunities at QCRI. I’m a PhD candidate in AI at Amirkabir University of Technology (AGML Center) with an MSc in AI from USI (Lugano). My research focuses on agentic AI and knowledge graph construction, and I have hands-on experience with ML/DL (PyTorch) and systems (FastAPI, Docker).

I’m particularly interested in combining VLMs/VLAs with structured knowledge (GraphRAG over crisis KGs) for trustworthy situational awareness and decision support in disaster response. My current work explores dual-learning validation (graph↔text) to reduce hallucinations in automatically built knowledge graphs. I also have publications in graph learning for medical data (ASD-GraphNet; Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2025; doi:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110723).

I’ve attached my CV, a tailored cover letter, and a one-page research interest note. I would be excited to contribute as a remote intern or research collaborator and would welcome a short call to discuss fit and potential directions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
