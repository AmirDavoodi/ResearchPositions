\noindent\textbf{\Large Research Interests --- Multimodal VLMs + Knowledge Graphs for Crisis Response}

\vspace{0.5em}

I am interested in building trustworthy multimodal foundation models (vision--language--action) that integrate structured knowledge for crisis and disaster management. My current research focuses on:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Agentic AI for Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC):} dual-learning validation (graph$\leftrightarrow$text) to reduce hallucinations and improve reliability in automatically built crisis/domain KGs.
    \item \textbf{GraphRAG-style retrieval and grounding:} aligning VLMs/VLAs with crisis knowledge graphs (entities, events, locations, resources), enabling explainable and auditable answers.
    \item \textbf{Temporal/event graphs from heterogeneous streams:} fusing social media, satellite/aerial imagery, and sensor/time-series into dynamic graphs for situational awareness.
    \item \textbf{Robustness, uncertainty, and XAI:} perturbation-based explanation for graph features; calibrated uncertainty for triage and prioritization.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example directions at QCRI:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item KG-augmented VLM grounding for geolocated crisis imagery and reports
    \item Event graph construction from social media streams with dual validation
    \item Multimodal GraphRAG for decision support (needs/resources matching, route planning)
    \item Benchmarks: reliability, faithfulness, and human factors for crisis AI
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recent work:} ASD-GraphNet (fMRI graph learning for autism diagnosis, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2025; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110723}{doi:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110723}). Under review: HIDE-KG --- dual-learning KGC with LLMs for reliable graph construction.
